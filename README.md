# SemioCore v1.1.0 — Paper-Facing Minimal Reproducible Artifact

This repository is a fixture-locked, paper-facing artifact for **SemioCore v1.1.0**. Its purpose is to make the project’s central claims **executable** (reproducible runs, stable outputs, and contract discipline) rather than merely descriptive.

Licensed under **CC BY 4.0** (see `LICENSE`).

## What is SemioCore?

SemioCore is a bioinformatic language and experimental infrastructure for studying the **semiodynamics of ageing**: the progressive loss of **biosemiotic plasticity** under **fixed interpretive regimes**.

SemioCore does not operate as a biomarker discovery tool, diagnostic system, or age predictor. Instead, it formalizes and makes auditable the interpretive contracts through which biological signals (biomarkers, time series, profiles) are turned into verdicts, trajectories, and inferences.

## What SemioCore is NOT

SemioCore:
- does NOT estimate biological age,
- does NOT diagnose disease,
- does NOT replace standard bioinformatic pipelines,
- does NOT claim to model biological mechanisms directly.

SemioCore operates at a methodological and interpretive layer: it studies the stability, coherence, contextuality, and indeterminacy of meaning-making processes applied to biomedical data.

## Scope and Limitations

SemioCore measures properties of interpretive dynamics, not biological entities. Its outputs are only meaningful relative to explicitly defined contracts, contexts, and ordering assumptions.

Results obtained with SemioCore must not be interpreted as direct biological, clinical, or causal claims without independent validation.

If you use SemioCore in academic, technical, or derivative work, you must cite it as:
